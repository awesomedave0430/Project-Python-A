# YSP Python A Final Project 
#What is the correlation between geography and property value and apparent health disparities present in the United States? 

#Geographical location plays a very significant role in determining life expectancy, and it is crucial to inform people about this relationship. Our project helps to establish an understanding of how where one lives can impact their lifespan, which is essential information for individuals, communities, and policymakers alike. Informing people about the impact of geographical location on life expectancy raises awareness about the inequalities that exist across different regions and it  highlights the health disparities that exist between different geographical areas, encouraging efforts to address these disparities and promote equal access to healthcare.
Our project also strives to empower individuals, as knowledge about the relationship between geography and life expectancy calls allow individuals to make informed decisions regarding their health and well-being. And in a broader context, understanding the prevalence of certain diseases in different regions helps individuals take preventive measures and adopt appropriate healthcare. 

#Our goal is to use the data from the data sets we have identified and code graphs/models which clearly and effectively display our information. We will code correlation graphs, and lines of best fits, and use the code learned to label our graphs (axis).
